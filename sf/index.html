Alright so this is like basically what has been going on since I’ve been in SF lol:

I flew into SF on Sunday, I had a stopover in LAX but didn’t get to see anything/anyone cool since it was just going from one gate to another. Took a shuttle from SF Airport to an AirBnB because my lease didn’t start till Monday. The Airbnb was chill, it was some like older woman who was super nice and basically was there for me for any questions i had about SF. It was a super duper small place she’s been living in for like 20 years which is crazy. I wanted to get my bus pass (which I later found it doesn’t activate till June -_- and I just kinda wandered and ended up wandering 30 minutes away from the Airbnb to go to a random Walgreens (oops). Then, I just watched the Warriors get absolutely spanked and chilled and FaceTimed a friend on Sunday night. Funny/Dumb Wayne story: When I was wandering, I saw a Tesla with no one in it and since I was in SF I assumed it was a self driving car, then I realized it was just parked (LOL).

Monday was my first day of work. I had to take all my suitcases and everything to work so I just called for a Lyft Ride share and the guy riding with me knew my new roommate weirdly enough. He was like the CEO/Founder of this coding school called MakeSchool in the area that was pretty popular and was a school that I looked into in the past so that was a crazy first meeting/experience. When I got to Yelp, I was absolutely stunned. The building was unlike anything I’ve seen before. You can google “140 New Montgomery” if you want to see it (https://www.google.com/search?q=140+new+montgomery&espv=2&biw=1184&bih=727&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiD18vCsvTMAhUPwWMKHRlTAe0Q_AUICCgD). There was like 8 elevators in there, and you just swipe your badge, type in a floor (yelp has floors 2-14) and it will direct you to the appropriate elevator that will get you there the fastest. Ultimate efficiency. (Max limit for people is 15 and my manager was in the elevator with 16 and it got stuck for an hour though. He’s been avoiding Elevator D all week now) I then went to my desk which was completely swagged out with a bunch of Yelp gear, USBs, lanyard, water bottles, some other stuff, and crazily enough Nerf Guns! My setup consists of a total of 3 monitors (a Macbook Pro 15’ and 2 pretty big monitors). You can kind of see it here ( https://vid.me/K7KL ). They took us on the tour of the floor. I found it super cool how like the Ceo Jeremy just like sits alongside all the other employees just the same as everyone else. Every floor has like fully stocked snacks with like all kind of chips, fruit snacks, cereals, fruits and drinks such as like sodas, vitamin waters, flavored drinks, fruit smoothies, basically every drink you would ever want. The 8th floor main cafe has everything and more, sandwiches burritos and so much more. They also have beer kegs which employees can use after 5 and a pool and ping pong table. They have like a coffee bar where you can get FREE gourmet coffee whenever you want, any style and they’ll make it for you. That’s what I think is unique but I’ve not had any because i don’t want to become caffeine dependent. I went out with half the team for a new hire lunch and we went to this super yummy Italian place to celebrate my joining of the company. I have another new hire lunch on Thursday to meet the other half of my team. Boss pays for everything. Last night (Monday). Took another Lyft from work to move into my apartment. Its a super small place but it has lots of storage and gets the job done. Ive been chilling in the lobby recently and only heading up to eat and sleep but so far its been pretty lonely in the lobby. Im getting along really well with my suite mate David. He’s from the area and he goes to school at Case Western in Cleveland. The guy I’m sharing my room with is a child protege named Jonah from Colorado but goes to Harvey Mudd. He’s very nice and respectful but like he talks very eloquent and the dude is only 17. He reads like very very complex books for fun and this kid is just a different breed. I had to walk liked 20 minutes to find a towel (Target). I got dinner at a vietnamese place with my roommate David because Ive never had pho before and the serving size was so much that i ate it for dinner today also and i have a little left. The viet place was cool except like i live in the city so its sketchy, the guy next at the table next to me was hella drugged up, kept giving the owners issues and was dealing pills. The hobos are crazy and i just try to avoid them since a lot of them are severely drugged up and picking up like cigarettes from cracks in the street. SF has the biggest hobo population in the country and they really are everywhere. Living in the city is a crazy experience and I know its an experience ill never have again (because its not cost efficient). Yesterday I was wearing my Illini hoodie after dinner and someone coming out of a conference center just yells I-L-L to me and runs up to me and starts talking to me. He said that Illini are everywhere in the bay and we had a solid like 7 minute talk while just walking. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. I’ve been walking to work so far and I probably will for the rest of may and its only a 20 minute walk and the weather is pretty good. Today at work was more of the same thing and my manager hit me with a nerf pellet from pretty far away. Interns split up into groups for lunch and I chose to go with my recruiter because she recruited me from UIUC and i wanted to talk to her. We went to an amazing Mediterranean place. My mentor Noah (who graduated from Berkley a year ago) took me out to the nearby park after lunch and he bought me a super nice Oreo cupcake and we just had a 1:1 convo about how work has been. 

As far as work goes, its a HUGE learning curve. I’m trying my best to keep up but its very hard and I haven’t seen most of the stuff before.I think I’m being harder on myself because like Im not getting as much done as I thought I would get done in my first couple days. Everyone is super patient though, my mentor Noah told me that no one works overtime and he’ll tell me to go home if he sees me working more than 8 hours (he told me to go home Monday). Im hoping i start settling down in a week or two and I can start enjoying life in SF, really trying to make good friends, and leave my work at work! Theres probably tons of stuff I forgot but so much has gone on in just 2 days that is hard to remember everything.

Thanks for reading :)
