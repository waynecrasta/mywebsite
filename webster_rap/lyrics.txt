Ladies and Gentlemen the name is Wayne
The swaggy boy yeah who always wear his chain
I heard you looking for a dope freestyle
From the kid with a million dollar smile

I went on YouTube looking for a beat
To show my friends who used to live on Webster Street
I was worried that you all would move away
Thank you God, most of y'all be in the Bay

Rakshit and Manasa up in San Jose
Playing FIFA you know we stay awake
3:30 we ain't taking a break
All we need we need is some RCB and Drake
And of course some of Manasa's almond cake (ay, ay, ay)

My flow so sick you might need medicine
Even the two of y'all there in Pleasanton
And Prathamesh out there building cars
With Elon telling him he wants to go to Mars
But honestly east bay kinda far
So Apoorva came to Del Mar
Hadn't drank that's a thirst she had to quench
Looking left, I saw her fall down off the bench

It was Webster that we all were introduced in
Now Shreya G is in Houston 
If anyone messes with her man, you are done
You in Texas go buy yourself a gun.

There a move where I almost cried
I got a text saying we bout to move to Bayside
But there's really no need to be bleak
Turns out, I been seeing y'all every week

There's another that left us in the Bay
A singer who had to move to LA
When she sings yeah she's always on key
First name Shru Last name D

Last of all there's one who's still here
Even if it's only one for more year
We gotta friendship that you cannot substitute
I'm talking about my home boy Arut

This is where this these freestyle ends
After all, Im just lucky y'all my friends
